# Oil Spill Detection using Google Earth Engine
An ilustrative example of this application is the analysis of the oil spill extent occured in the Suez Gulf in summer 2020. In red colour the area affected by a significant drop of the coherence values before and after the explosion event.

The scope of this repository is to provide resources and examples to help you leverage SAR data using Anomaly Detection approach using Google Earth Engine for oil spill detection.
The usage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for Coherence Change Detection provides relevant information in phenomena with big changes, that could be consequence of natural or anthropogenic actions. Satellite remote sensing data is able to retrieve information from inaccessible or critical areas, even under cloud conditions, being an unvaluable tool for operational monitoring activities. 

The developed GEE code indicates where the user input is needed.
