# GOST_SAR_applications

This repository contains resources and examples to help you leverage SAR data (and optical data) for various mapping applications, in Google Earth Engine and COLAB. 
Let us know if you have tried any of the solutions presented, we'd love to hear about your use cases!

## Resources

1. Flood mapping
 - guidance for choosing the appropriate methodology to map flood extent
 - GEE scripts for flood mapping and damage assessment using S1 radar data and S2 optical data
 - COLAB script for cloud masking and flood mapping using S2 optical data
 
2. Coherence change detection
 - COLAB script using S1 data

## Examples - study cases

1. Flash Flood India - Tapovan Dam area (02.07.2021)
2. Explosion in Bata, Equatorial Guinea (03.07.2021)
3. Explosion in Beirut,Lebanon (08.04.2020)
